* Specification for the OSS World app
** Overall Goals

OSS world seeks to offer worldbuilders a cheap and effective alternative to
proprietary worldbuilding software. It is intended to be:

 - Highly modular
 - Inclusive of a variety of features through modules

** Specific Architecture

The central app will simply be a landing platform. It will provide hooks to
allow modules to communicate and will create a gui to allow access to other
modules through a menu type system.
