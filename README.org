The Open Source Software World is a tool for worldbuilding, intended to tailor
to the individual user's needs. Rather than a single developer guessing what a
given user will need, the OSS World focuses on being modular, allowing each user
to use only the plugins which help them most.

** Why the OSS World?

There is a variety of fantastic worldbuilding software available for creators.
What sets the OSS world apart?

- It's free, yeah I like my money as much as you do.
- It's open source, you can see exactly what the software does to your precious
  world and even adjust it to your liking.
- It's modular. Developers aren't trying to tailor to many users, instead each
  plugin developer can focus on a small target audience.  

** Installation and Usage

As you can probably tell, the OSS World is still in super-early alpha. Right now
few plugins exists, and the program won't serve functionally for a while. What
you see here is more of a proof of concept and a way for plugin developers to
begin work.

First ensure you have Java 8 and [[https://github.com/boot-clj/boot][boot]] installed.

To build an uberjar run this in the project directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  boot build -u target
#+END_SRC

To start the application run:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  java -jar target/oss-world.jar
#+END_SRC

** Contributing

The biggest way to contribute is to develop more plugins for the OSS World. For
more information on how to do this, see the [[file:plugin-specification.org][plugin specification.]] See the plugin
list below on what has already been done (and consider contributing to those
plugins). Note that develop does not include solely code, design and ideas are
also greatly needed.

You can also help out with testing and bug reports. Submit any bugs (or
suggestions) at the OSS World's [[https://github.com/oss-world/oss-world/issues][issue tracker]] or at individual plugins' issue 
trackers.

*** Example Plugins

For example plugins' source see the [[https://github.com/oss-world/oss-world-example-clojure][clojure plugin]] and the [[https://github.com/oss-world/oss-world-example-java][java plugin]]. 

** Available Plugins

*There's nothing here, post an issue to the [[https://github.com/oss-world/oss-world/issues][tracker]] to ask me to add your plugin*
